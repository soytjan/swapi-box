# SWapi Box

## Synopsis

This was an individual project designed to get us comfortable with writing asynchronous nested fetch calls, start working with React Router, and to continue practicing writing React components. Fetch calls were made to the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/documentation) to get data about 'People', 'Vehicles', and 'Planets.' This data was then used to build a dynamic web application that displayed this information in cards on the page. There is also a complete testing suite using Jest and Enzyme.

The project guidelines can be found [here](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

## Motivation

This project reinforced the necessity to write modular React components and methods. This was also my first time dealing with nested API calls and using `async` and `await`. It also gave me the chance to dabble with React Router.
